# MERN Book Store App

## Introduction

Welcome to the MERN Book Store App! This application is a full-featured online bookstore built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It allows users to browse, purchase, and manage books seamlessly through an intuitive user interface.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts:

### Backend:
The backend serves as the server-side component of the application, handling API requests, managing database operations, and serving as the backbone for the frontend application.

1. **Entry Point**: `index.js` is the main entry point of the application.
2. **Configuration**: `config.js` holds configuration settings.
3. **Models**: Mongoose schemas and models are defined in the `models` directory.
4. **Routes**: API endpoints and handlers are defined in the `routes` directory.
5. **Dependencies**: Managed using `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.

### Frontend:
The frontend serves as the client-side component of the application, providing a user-friendly interface for users to interact with.

1. **Entry Point**: `index.html` and `src/main.jsx` set up the React app and render the root component.
2. **Configuration**: Configuration files such as `vite.config.js` and `postcss.config.js`.
3. **Components**: Reusable React components in `src/components`.
4. **Pages**: Different pages of the application in `src/pages`.
5. **Redux**: Store setup and slices for managing application state in `src/store`.
6. **Styling**: Tailwind CSS configuration in `tailwind.config.js`.
7. **Public Assets**: Static assets like images and fonts in the `public` directory.

## Setup

To set up and run the MERN Book Store App, follow these steps:

### Backend:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**: Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the backend and add the necessary environment variables.

   ```env
   MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   PORT=your_preferred_port
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ```

4. **Run the Server**:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Frontend:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Development Server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Common Errors and Solutions

Here are some common errors you might encounter during setup and their solutions:

| Error                       | Reason                                           | Solution                                                                                                                                                       |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **MongoDB Connection Error**| Failed to connect to MongoDB                     | Check your MongoDB server status and verify the `MONGO_URI` in the `.env` file.                                                                                |
| **Port Already in Use**     | Specified port is already in use                 | Change the `PORT` value in the `.env` file to a different port number.                                                                                         |
| **Missing Dependencies**    | Required modules are not installed               | Run `npm install` to install all required dependencies.                                                                                                        |
| **JWT Secret Not Set**      | Missing JWT_SECRET in environment variables      | Ensure that the `.env` file contains a `JWT_SECRET` variable.                                                                                                  |
| **CORS Policy Error**       | Cross-origin requests are blocked                | Install and configure the `cors` middleware in your Express app. Add `const cors = require('cors'); app.use(cors());` to your `index.js` file.                 |
| **SyntaxError: Unexpected token** | JSON parsing error                            | Verify that the request payloads sent to the server are properly formatted JSON.                                                                               |
